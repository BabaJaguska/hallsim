# HallSim: A Modular, Multi-Scale Simulator for Aging Biology
[![Basic CI/CD Workflow](https://github.com/BabaJaguska/HallSim/actions/workflows/basic_CI_linux.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BabaJaguska/HallSim/actions/workflows/basic_CI_linux.yaml)

## üß¨ Background & Motivation

Aging is a complex, network-level phenomenon. Its "hallmarks" ‚Äî such as mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, and altered intercellular communication ‚Äî do not act in isolation. Instead, they form dense webs of feedback and crosstalk.

Traditional approaches to modeling aging have been reductionist. Inspired by conceptual frameworks like [Cohen et al. (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37117782/), HallSim aims to embrace complex systems theory and explore emergent properties of aging arising from loss of resilience across multiple sub-systems.

## üåü Project Goals

* Build a modular, multi-scale agent-based simulator
* Allow plug-and-play modules (ODE/SBML) with exposed high level abstractions corresponding to 12 hallmarks of aging
* Incorporate an LLM layer helping integrate new modules in a semi-automated way
* Enable simulation of aging trajectories, interventions, and emergent phenotypes
* Eventually serve as an in-silico testbed for perturbations (radiation, caloric restriction, therapies, etc.)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Architecture:

* Each Cell has a `CellState` representing internal biology
* Multiple Submodels (e.g., ERiQ, neuralode) plug into a Cell
* Cells reside on a 2D grid (expandable to 3D, need to add spatial dynamics)
* Simulation operates through `Diffrax` ODE integration
* Models of unknown dynamics or surrogate models can be trained as a NeuralODE using `optax` and `equinox`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started


`make install` or `make install-dev` for developers.

`make test` will run a series of pytest tests.

`make run` will run the default simulation, or you can do `simulate basic` (mitochondrial damage sim)
or `simulate kick` to add a step perturbation to the basic simulation.
cli.py is your entry point, where you control the CLI and what options it offers.

---

## üß∞ Dev Instructions

pyproject.toml is the single source of dependendies, compiled when you run `make update`.

## üõãÔ∏è Roadmap

* [x] JSON-based CellState initialization
* [x] Make a model factory and cell agent wrapper
* [x] Port ERiQ to JAX
* [x] Allow generic NeuralODE training 
* [ ] Add more models as submodules from literature
* [ ] Enable SBML and other standardized format support
* [ ] Expose higher level input (hallmarks) and output (phenotypes)
* [ ] Add SDE noise terms
* [ ] Add 3D support for spatial diffusion & ECM modelling (CAX or PhysiCell integration? Vertex models?)
